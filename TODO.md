# Web Quotes TODO

- [x] E-ink busy pin versus timeout (would have to solder wire to pad).
- [x] Need to actually parse HTTP message (have side C++ project).
- [ ] Probably do these in side projects to get working code:
  - [x] Logic break text at word bounds?
  - [ ] Drawing a bender Bitmap
- [ ] Figure out SSID and password stuff. There's an open source lib for this.
- [x] Need to power down after displaying.

## Low Priority
- [ ] Better HTTP message building without strcat.
- [ ] Make GitHub repo for StringView?
